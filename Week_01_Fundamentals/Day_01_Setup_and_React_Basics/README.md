# Day 1: React Setup & JSX Fundamentals

This folder encapsulates the initial steps of my React learning journey. On Day 1, the primary focus was on getting the development environment ready and understanding the absolute core building blocks of a React application.

**Key activities and concepts covered:**

* **Setting up the React Development Environment:** This included installing necessary tools like Node.js, npm/yarn, and configuring essential VS Code extensions for efficient React development.
* **Starting a New React Project:** Hands-on experience with initializing a new React application, likely using Vite or Create React App, and exploring the initial project structure.
* **Vite React App Lookaround:** A first tour of the default Vite React project, understanding its file organization and what's generated out-of-the-box.
* **JSX Fundamentals:** Diving deep into JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript, which allows writing HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. This involved understanding how React uses JSX to describe UI, elements, and components.

This day lays the crucial groundwork for building interactive user interfaces with React.
